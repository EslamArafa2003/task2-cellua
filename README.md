1. Mounting Google Drive and Extracting the Dataset

Purpose: To access and extract the dataset stored on Google Drive for use in the Colab environment.
Process: The dataset ZIP file is extracted to a specified directory in Colab, making the images available for training.

2. Directory Setup

Purpose: To define the paths for training, validation, and test datasets.
Process: Variables store these paths to organize the data for the model's input.

3. Data Augmentation and Image Generators

Purpose: To enhance the training data using augmentation and to prepare data for feeding into the model.
Process:
Train Data: Augmented using transformations like rotation, shifting, and flipping to increase the model's generalization.
Validation & Test Data: Only rescaled (no augmentation) to maintain data integrity during evaluation.

4. Model Setup with ResNet50

Purpose: To leverage a pre-trained ResNet50 model for transfer learning.
Process:
Base Model: ResNet50 is loaded with pre-trained ImageNet weights, excluding the top layers.
Custom Layers: Added on top of ResNet50 to adapt the model for the specific task (Teeth classification).

5. Training the Model

Purpose: To train the model using the prepared data.
Process:
Initial Training: Train with frozen ResNet50 layers.
Fine-Tuning: Unfreeze some layers and continue training with a reduced learning rate for better accuracy.

6. Evaluation

Purpose: To assess the model's performance on the test data.
Process: The model is evaluated, and accuracy is printed.

7. Potential Improvements

Purpose: To achieve higher accuracy 
Suggestions:
Data Augmentation: Enhance with more aggressive augmentation.
Fine-Tuning: Unfreeze more layers and train longer.
Optimizer Tuning: Experiment with different optimizers like AdamW or learning rate schedules.
Regularization: Add techniques like L2 regularization or Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
